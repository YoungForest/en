It is a painful process to book an France visa appointment. A tool was implemented to notify you when a new slot is released. As a 9 years of expereinced software engineer, I finally beat the scalpers and got my France visa appointment by the script. A software engineer never bows to scalpers.

Currently, only Dublin Ireland appointments are supported. Please read the instructions docs to learn how to use it: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uHJCxINt9Sb0f1HHybCFhxkmpzxRURilsxqD6OQLpQ4/edit?usp=sharing)
