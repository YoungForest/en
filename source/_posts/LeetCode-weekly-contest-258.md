From this week, I will write my summary posts for the LeetCode weekly and biweekly contests in English. Before this, I have written more than 100 LeetCode contests summary posts in Chinese. For future international interviews and jobs opportunities, I believe writing English LeetCode summary is a good way to improve my expression and algorithm.
