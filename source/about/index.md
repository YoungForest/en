Hiï¼Œeveryone!
I'm Forest. A programmer from Amazon Beijing, China.
This is my personal **English** blog. If you prefer Chinese, refer to [**Here**](https://youngforest.github.io).
Here I will share my learning and life as a record.
You could find me in other social platforms too. Feel free to get touch with me.
